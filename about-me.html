        <p style="margin-bottom: 0px">Hello, My name is Lou, I'm a trans woman. <br> I am currently taking Creative
            Computing at the University Of Portsmouth, this website was created as part of the Introduction to
            Interactive Development module. <br> Some of my interests include computing and video games. <br> Some
            information about me, as young as I can remember I've known my gender identity did not align with what I was
            assigned at birth, when I was 12 I came out as non-binary, but when I was 15/16 I realised that wasn’t the
            right label for me, so since then I’ve known I was trans, but due to where I was living at the time, it
            wasn’t safe for me to come out. However since I moved to Portsmouth and I’ve been living my life as a woman,
            I’ve never been happier. Ive also known since I was 12 that my sexuality is Pansexual.</p>
