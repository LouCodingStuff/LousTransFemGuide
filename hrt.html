            Welcome to the HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) page. This page is dedicated to talking about hormones that
            are often taken by Transgender Women to help them feel more comfortable in their bodies due to the changes
            that these hormones bring about.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 20px; margin: 0px;">Estrogen is the main sex hormone in female bodies
            which is responsible for effecting a wide range of things in the female body, like the menstrual cycle,
            estrogen affects the reproductive tract, breasts, and the brain. This hormones however can me supplemented
            in the body of Transgender Women to better align the body of that person with their gender identity. The use
            of estrogen in HRT is often used to ease the pressure that one feels due to Gender Dysphoria (a condition
            defined as a marked incongruence between ones experienced or expressed gender identity and the gender they
            were assigned at birth). The effects of taking Estrogen as a Transwoman can vary between persons, however
            the most commen results of it are, Breast growth, fat distribution changes (fat is likley to build around
            the hips and thighs and the muscles in the arms and legs become less defined), and slowed growth of body
            hair (this is sometimes aided too by taking another part of HRT called Anti-Androgens). There also some
            "negatives" to taking Estrogen in Transgender Women who havent recieved bottom surgery, which include
            decreased testicular size and erectile dysfuntion.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 20px; margin: 0px;">Anti-Androgens are a type of medication that block
            the effects of the androgen hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone which are the primary sex
            hormones in cisgender males. The two main Anti-Androgen medications are Cyproterone Acetate and
            Spironolactone. In cisgender males androgen hormones are responsible effecting the genital tract, secondary
            sexual
            characteristics, and fertility. When combined with the use of Estrogen,
            Testosterone stops being the primary sex hormone in the body and Estrogen takes over, this can lead to
            effects like softer skin, decreased body and facial hair growth, and breast development. Another notable
            anti-androgen is Finasteride which mainly blocks the effects of dihydrotestosterone, this anti-androgen is
            used in cis-gender males to aid in slowing the rate of which their hairline recedes, which is why it is an
            option to transgender women aswell but not used primarily due to its ability to only block one hormone.

        <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Accessing HRT through the NHS</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 0px; font-weight: bold;"> This guide can be followed for both MTF and FTM people.</p>


        <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 20px;">

            The first thing you need to do will be to set up an appointment with your GP. In this appointment you will
            need to talk to a clinician about getting a referral to a GIC (Gender Identity Clinic), you may want to know
            which specific GIC you want to be referred to you can find a list <a
                href="https://genderkit.org.uk/resources/gender-services/"> here</a>. During this appointment the
            clinician may take your height, weight, and blood pressure and may ask you to have some blood drawn for
            testing. <br>
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 20px; font-weight: bold;">
            Please note that during this appointment the clinician should not ask to examine your chest or genitalia.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 20px;">
            They may also ask some general questions like, What is your current gender identity and pronouns? Have you
            previously attended a gender clinic? Are you taking any hormones? Do you need any support to attend
            appointments (e.g. an interpreter, advocate or carer). What medications do you currently take?
            <br>
            <br>
            They could also ask some more specific questions about your gender identity, this may include When did you
            start feeling
            something was wrong related to your gender? Did you experiment with gender during childhood (clothes, hair,
            makeup, etc)? Have you made a name change? If not, do you have a preferred name? Have you updated your NHS
            records? Have you made any public changes to your gender presentation?
            <br>
            <br>
            Another Set of questions that may be asked about your medical conditions. These could be questions about any
            mental health conditions, DSD or intersex conditions, ADHD or autism, learning disabilities or a
            developmental disorder, or a history of self-harming or suicidal behaviour. You could also be asked some
            lifestyle questions like Do you use any recreational drugs? Do you drink? Do you smoke?
            <br>
            <br>
            If the appointment goes well and the clinician agrees to refer you to a GIC, you should get some form of
            communication that confirms you have been added to their waitlist (This is usually done by letter). This may
            take a few weeks to be completed but if you have not received anything after this time, it would be
            advisable to contact the GIC and your GP to check that the referral has been received correctly. Please note
            that waitimes to be seen by a GIC are very long, there is estimated tracker you can find <a
                href="https://genderkit.org.uk/resources/wait-times/">here</a>, provided by genderkit.org.uk.
            <br>
            <br>
            During your first appointment at the GIC, you maybe asked the same questions as you were during your first
            visit to your GP. This is just so that your clinician can get a better view of your situation as it is
            likely the information from your first appointment with the GP was not shared with the GIC. They may also
            take a blood sample to establish basic good health, this could include liver function and hormone levels.
            Please note, during your appointment don’t be afraid to ask if you don’t understand. For example, ‘Can you
            say that again? I still don’t understand.’ Or if you don’t understand anything ask for it to be written down
            by the doctor to be explained or if applicable by a family member or friend who is present. During your
            second appointment with the GIC, this is where your clinician will most likely look at your blood results
            and discuss starting hormones.
